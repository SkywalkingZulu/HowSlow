This is an in-browser bandwidth and RTT (roundtrip time) estimator based on a Service Worker and the Resource Timing API.


## How does it work?

Basicaly, the Service Worker includes an algorythm that reads previous [Resource Timing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Resource_Timing_API/Using_the_Resource_Timing_API), uses them to estimate the connectivity metrics and constantly adjusts them after every newly downloaded resource.

Estimated bandwidth and RTT are available both in the Service Worker and the JavaScript scope of the page for a large variety of behaviors.


## What is it good for?

Send some love ‚ù§Ô∏è to your slower users:
+ load lower quality images
+ avoid loading some third parties such as ads, retargeting tags, AB Testing...
+ display a clickable thumbnail instead of a video
+ replace your dynamic map by a static one
+ use an aggressive "cache then network" Service Worker strategy
+ show a "please wait" message on Ajax actions
+ ... (add your ideas here)

But you can also think the other way üîÉ and enhance your website quality on high speed connections, load beautiful HD images, start videos...


## How to install?

*TODO: make it available as an NPM package*

### Step 1: Load howSlowForPage.js and instantiate it

Grab the howSlowForPage.js script, transpile it to ES5 (because it's written in ES6), and load it on the page whenever you want. But the sooner it's loaded, the sooner the service worker will be ready.

And just after it's loaded, you need to instantiate it with the path to the service worker.

```html
<script src="/scripts/howSlowForPage.js"></script>
<script>window.howslow = new HowSlowForPage('forSW.js');</script>
```

### Step 2: Build the service worker and serve it at the root level

Grab the howSlowForSW.js script and add your custom `myUrlRewritingFunction` function at the top. If you do not want your service worker to change any URL, just write a function that returns null:

```js
function myUrlRewritingFunction() {
    return null;
}
```

Note: You don't need to transpile the service worker's code, as all Service Workers compatible browsers can understand ES6. 

### Step 3: Use the estimated bandwidth or RTT

If you need the stats in the page's scope, they're available like this:

```js
if (howslow.bandwidth > 1000) { // Remember, bandwidth is in KBps (1 Kilo Bytes = 8 Kilo bits)
    videoPlayer.init();
}

if (howslow.rtt < 50) { // Roundtrip Time is in milliseconds
    loadThirdParties();
}
```

If you need them in the Service Worker's scope, they're here:

```js
estimator.getBandwidth();
estimator.getRTT();
```

And here is an exemple using `myUrlRewritingFunction`:
```js
function myUrlRewritingFunction(url) {
    
    // Let's intercept every editorial image call
    const regexp = /images\/editorial\/(.*)\.jpg$/;
    const execResult = regexp.exec(url);

    if (execResult !== null && estimator.getBandwidth() > 1000) {
        // Add an "-hd" suffix to the image name
        return '/images/editorial/' + execResult[1] + '-hd.jpg';
    }

    // Respond null for the default behavior
    return null;
}
```


## Will it work on the first page load?

The first time it's called, the Service Worker needs to instantiate and initialize itself. For that reason, it only gets available after a few seconds and you might miss entirely the first page load. But it'll be ready for the next page, or the next user action if it's a Single Page Application.


## Ok, great. But what's the difference with the Network Information API?

The [Network Information API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NetworkInformation) is not yet mature and is only able to provide bandwidth/RTT estimations on Chrome Desktop. Smartphones are not supported.


## Compatibility

It's compatible with the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox and Safari (v11.3). Unfortunately, Edge (v17) is not compatible. We're looking for a workaround.

However, Service Workers are quite unpredictable and you should not rely on this tool for important tasks. Use it for **progressive enhancement**.
